# Dark Matter

Dark Matter is a highly opinionated domain mapping plugin for WordPress multisites, designed
to work out of the box as-is with no setup.

Unlike other plugins such as Donncha's "WordPress MU Domain Mapping" and WPMU Dev's premium
domain mapping plugin, Dark Matter offers virtually no options.

It is designed specifically to work as follows;

* To have separate domain for /wp-admin/ and for the front-end websites.
* Provide per blog administrator users the ability to map a domain for their website.
* Ensure that the WordPress Admin Bar is visible on all mapped domains using a basic single sign-on implementation.
